          The moisturising oils used in out soaps will produce a rich, luxurious
          lather that will leave your skin clean and soft without stripping it
          of its natural oils. All of our scented bars may be used for the face,
          body, shampoo, beard wash, or shaving lather soap.

          Our shop features artisan, handcrafted, vegan soaps made using the
          finest oils, butters, and plant based botanicals. We take great pride
          in keeping our products as natural as possible without any unnecessary
          additives, harmful chemicals, or harsh ingredients.

          Our soap is made the traditional way. Since our skin is our largest
          organ, it is better to choose cold processed soaps made from scratch
          rather than melt and pour soaps with ingredients you are unsure of.
          All of our soap is truly handmade from scratch and we never melt and
          pour premade glycerin soap in any element of our soap-making process.

            The second I started opening the packaging, the beautiful smell of
            these soaps filled the room! We are so excited to include these in
            our wedding favor package for guests! The shipping was very quick &
            the quality looks amazing!

            Very cute and high quality! We used the soaps as giveaway for an
            event and people loved them.

            Great product! Smells amazing and feels even better on the skin. Not
            to mention that Soapy even kept in mind my small request regarding
            the colours of the soaps to match my baby shower's theme. Thank you
            so much, definitely recommend.
